    <h2>Calculate BMI value</h2>
    <p>
      This document provides an opportunity to calculate a more accurate BMI
      value based on given known height and weight either by using the metric or
      imperial unit system. For this calculator, the imperial unit system is
      chosen by default. However, the user can select the imperial unit system
      in the drop-down menu below.
    </p>
    <h3>Choose Unit System:</h3>
    <select name="unit_system" id="unit_system">

    <h2>About BMI</h2>
    <p>
      The
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index" target="blank"
        >Body Mass Index</a
      >
      (<span style="font-style: italic">BMI</span> for short) is a value often
      used to determine a person's physical health by considering a person's
      weight in relation to height. By calculating and evaluating a BMI value,
      it can be determined whether a person is underweight, of normal weight,
      overweight, obese or extremely obese.
      <br />
      <br />
      According to
      <a
        href="https://www.who.int/gho/ncd/risk_factors/bmi_text/en/"
        target="_blank"
        >World Health Organization</a
      >
      (<span style="font-style: italic">WHO</span>
      for short) millions on people die each year worldwide as a direct result
      of being overweight or obese. Body mass has a huge impact on a person's
      long term health which is why the BMI value is a relevant way to indicate
      a person's physical health.
      <br />
      <br />
      A BMI which is too hight and therefore suggests that a person stores more
      mass than optimal for someone of their height comes with various health
      risks such as
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>High blood pressure</li>
      <li>Type 2 diabetes</li>
      <li>Stroke</li>
      <li>Coronary heart disease</li>
    </ul>
    The BMI value should ideally be inbetween 18 and 24 as this spectrum
    suggests that a particular individual is of normal weight. This weight
    category is ideal because it comes with fewer health risks. A BMI below 18
    indicates a state of being underweight and above 24 is overweight if not
    obese or extremely obese.
    <br />
    <br />
    The BMI chart displayed below illustrates the relation between height and
    weight and how. Assuming height is fixed, as weight decreases, so does the
    BMI value and the BMI value increases as weight increases.

    <ul style="list-style: circle">
      <li>
        In the BMI chart the color
        <span style="color: #34c8f4; font-weight: bold">blue</span> marks a BMI
        up to 18 that indicates being underweight.
      </li>
      <li>
        A BMI between 18 and 24 illustrated with the color
        <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold">green</span> is classified
        as being healthy.

        The
        <span style="color: yellow; font-weight: bold; background-color: grey"
          >yellow</span
        >
        is used for a BMI range from 25 to 29 indicating being overweight.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span style="color: #f6940a; font-weight: bold">Orange</span> marks a
        BMI range between 30 and 39 classified as being obese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lastly the color
        <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">red</span> used for a BMI
        past 40 is used for extreme obesity.
